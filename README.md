Program uses Thread Hijacking to Inject Native Shellcode into a Standard Win32 Application

## About 
I developed this small project to continue my experiences of different code injection methods.
With Thread Hijacking, it allows the hijacker.exe program to susepend a thread within the target.exe program
allowing us to write shellcode to a thread.
